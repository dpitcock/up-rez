Guests can expect a seamless, automated process when accepting an offer, with clear communication and minimal manual steps required from them.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Instant Confirmation**  
   Upon clicking "Accept Offer," you'll see an immediate confirmation screen with the new listing details, total balance due, and estimated processing time (typically 2-5 minutes).

2. **Automatic Payment Processing**  
   Our system securely charges the remaining balance for the new accommodation using your original payment method. You'll receive a payment receipt via email within 1 minute.

## Reservation Changes by Booking Source

**Direct Bookings (via our portal)**  
- Original reservation instantly updates to new listing/dates
- All existing details (guest names, payment, special requests) carry over automatically

**OTA/Agency Bookings (Booking.com, Airbnb, Expedia, etc.)**  
- Original OTA reservation cancelled automatically (OTA refund processed within 24-48 hours)
- New direct reservation created in our system under your name/email
- You'll get both cancellation confirmation and new booking details
