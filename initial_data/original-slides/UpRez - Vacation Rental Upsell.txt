UpRez
Short-term rental up-and-cross selling platform
Think of a whitelabel OTA only for those properties a PM has control of, and a email/sms marketing tool that triggers when a certain criteria is met, which has preset filters on the OTA query, that shows the difference in price and discount to what the user already paid.

Care for an upgrade?
Let’s get closer to the beach
The kids would love the pool
The kids can bring friends!
Nice. We can bring the dog
Think Cousin Rob would want to join?

The early bird deal for admissions is great
That’s the house I was talking about
I could really use an office
Now we can take grandma
We can give each child their own room




Why it works?
Framing Effect
Prices seem cheaper
Discount is offered on the difference in price, not total amount
Hot Market
Current reservation confirms their intent and dates to travel
Activities, attractions and tours are yet to be booked
Better Info
More decisions made
Budgets and logistics determined
Intent of other parties shown
Framing affect
Captive market
better understanding

Please Note:
Typical booking-site conversion is 1%
Thresholds can be set to auto-stop upgrades based off availability
Restrictions can be set on who and when these discounts are offered
Fee differences will also be added
100% discount is still advantageous, as it increases reviews, still leads to ancillaries and opens up a hot selling property at a higher price. You cannot do that when ‘bumping’ the guest on arrival.
